Welcome to HydraGen's wiki!

HydraGen is an open-source tool that generates and emulates microservice-based benchmarks with different computational complexities and topologies in a systematic and reproducible way. It is intended to be used for evaluating performance at scale of web-serving applications, with major focus on inter-service communication properties. It enables thorough experimental evaluation of the implications of diverse application properties on the performance and scalability of cloud-native resource management mechanisms. HydraGen includes a set of tuning knobs that can be used to configure:

* The topology of the microservice-based application
* The computational complexity of each microservice
* The characteristics of the traffic between paired microservices
* Deployment characteristics related to microservice placement and scalability
