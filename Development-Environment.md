# Cloud-Native-App-Simulator Community

Welcome to the Cloud-Native-App-Simulator community!

This is the starting point for becoming a contributor - improving code, 
improving docs, etc.

## Introduction

Cloud-Native-App-Simulator is an open source microservice benchmark suite 
for generating complete implementations of more generic architectural patterns
for microservices.

## Development Enviornment
This document helps you get started developing code for Cloud-Native-App-Simulator.
If you follow this guide and find a problem, please take a few minutes to update this page.

The Cloud-Native-App-Simulator build system is designed to run with minimal dependencies:
- kind
- docker
- git

These dependencies need to be set up before building and running the code.
- [Setting Up Docker](#setting-up-docker)
- [Build the worker image](#build-the-worker-image)
- [Setting Up Kind](#setting-up-kind)


### Setting Up Docker
To use docker to build required images you will need:
- **docker tools:** To download and install Docker follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

### Build the worker image
Now we need to build the docker image and push it to the kind clusters to test.
```
cd model/
docker build -t app-demo .
```
### Setting Up Kind
To be able to run the *app-demo container* on a sample cluster, we use 
[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- **Installation:** To download and install Kind follow [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
- **Setup the clusters:** To setup the clusters, you could simply run the [`kind-setup-clusters.sh`](kind-setup-clusters.sh)
script.
```
#
# This will create multiple Kind clusters (default 2)
# The naming of each cluster is followed by the number (ie, cluster-1, cluster-2, etc.)
# Each of the created clusters has 3 worker nodes and one control plane by default.
#


cd community
./kind-setup-clusters.sh [number of clusters (default 2)] [config of each cluster (default kind-cluster-3-nodes.yaml)]
```

### Pushing the image to a cluster
Initially when you setup a cluster, the initial image is pushed to the clusters, but you might need to 
push the image in all kind clusters. 

```
cd community
./push-image-to-clusters [number of clusters (default 2)]
```

### Logging
To be able to have logging, simply follow the instructions in [Logging](./Logging.md).
