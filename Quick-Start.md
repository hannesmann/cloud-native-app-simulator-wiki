# Build and upload Docker images

Build docker image for main application
1. Under [model](/model) directory, run:

``` bash
docker build -t app-demo .
```

After creating the docker images, upload them to each of the clusters 'i' by runnning:
``` bash
kind load docker-image app-demo --name={cluster$i}
```

## Dependecies
1. kind
2. tsung
3. istioctl
4. kubectl
5. go (for installation, configuration and basic testing, follow instructions in e.g. [How to Install GoLang (Go Programming Language) in Linux](HTtps://www.tecmint.com/install-go-in-linux/); make sure go environment variables and path are configured accordingly)

## Environment Preparation
1. To generate and deploy microservice-based applications, go to the /generator directory
2. Make sure the /generator directory is located under path ~/go_projects/src/ and initialize module by executing go mod init
3. If needed, install go module dependencies, e.g. cobra and yaml
4. Modify any of the input files under the **input** directory according to your own requirements (see some json examples under the **examples** directory).
5. Generate and deploy kubernetes manifest files by running the 'generator.sh' script. This command can be run under two different modes: (i) 'random' mode which generates a random description file or (ii) 'preset' mode which generates Kubernetes manifest based on a description file in the input directory". Note that this commands generates k8s yaml files which are stored under the **k8s** directory (see some yaml examples under the **examples** directory).
  ```bash
  ./generator.sh {mode} {input file}
  ```  
6. Modify the necessary files for request generation with tsung
    - Change the initial field of json files under the **tsung** directory according the chain configuration.
    - Change the chain_no field of json files under the **tsung** directory according the chain configuration. For example, for first chain it should be **1**
    - Update the request_task_type of json files under the **tsung** directory for assigning user defined task to each microservice in the chain
    - Change server host ip address in conf.xml file with istio-ingress gateway for first microservice in chain.
    - Change the chain json file under the request section in conf.xml to send request to the desired chain. For example, if first chain is targeted it should be **chain1.json**
7. Change Kubernetes context to the main cluster
```bash
kubectl config use-context cluster1
```
## Running
After configuring environment correctly, you can just use the following command the start request generator.
```bash
tsung -f tsung/conf.xml -k start
```
You can observe the performance metrics for both istio and chain by using the dashboards on grafana interface.
To stop traffic generation useÂ´
```bash
tsung stop
```
